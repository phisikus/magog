To make it work:
1. Check if base_url in bootstrap.php is correct.
2. Make "cache" and "logs" directories writable. 
3. In config directory there are two example configuration files - for MySQL and PostgreSQL - choose one and make symlink (database.php).
4. Create 'magog' database by using one of provided SQL scripts.
5. Open browser:  /magog/index.php/admin/    Default user/password: admin/admin
